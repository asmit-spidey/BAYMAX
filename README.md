### Problem Statement:
In many parts of the world, access to immediate healthcare advice is limited, particularly in rural areas. While telemedicine has made strides, there is still a need for a more accessible, easy-to-use, and personalized solution.  
*BAYMAX- Ghar Wala Doctor* aims to bridge this gap by combining three powerful tools: a *mental health chatbot, a **disease predictor, and a **symptom checker*, all accessible from the comfort of your home. This solution aims to provide timely assistance to individuals seeking healthcare advice or support, making healthcare more accessible.

### Proposed Solution:
*BAYMAX- Ghar Wala Doctor* will provide an integrated solution for both physical and mental health, with the following features:  
- *Symptom Checker*: Users input their symptoms, and the system suggests potential conditions, helping them determine whether to seek professional medical advice.  
- *Disease Predictor*: By providing basic health information (age, blood pressure, glucose levels, etc.), the system predicts the risk of common diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.  
- *Mental Health Chatbot*: A conversational chatbot that listens to users, detects emotional patterns, and provides supportive responses, offering self-care tips and directing users to professionals if needed.

### Solution Description:
*BAYMAX- Ghar Wala Doctor* will use a combination of machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and rule-based systems to provide health solutions.  
- *Symptom Checker*: We will implement a disease prediction model using datasets from Kaggle, with a machine learning classifier to suggest possible conditions based on symptom input.  
- *Disease Predictor*: This module will be powered by trained models that assess the likelihood of diseases like diabetes or heart disease based on user-provided data.  
- *Mental Health Chatbot*: We will leverage NLP tools to provide a conversational experience, where the chatbot can analyze text and respond with supportive and empathetic messages. It will also detect patterns indicating stress or anxiety.  
- *Integration: All these features will be hosted on a web interface using **React.js* for the front end, with *Python* and *Flask* powering the backend.  
The app will be easy to use, intuitive, and provide helpful insights for users to take control of their health.
